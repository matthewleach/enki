What is the biggest downfall to using absolute paths?

???

* You donâ€™t have control over files on other domains and if they are moved, your links will break. 
* The paths tend to be longer and add to the filesize of a web page.
* Those paths have lower search engine visibility.
* For downloadable files, absolute paths will not work.
* Relative paths will load the link faster.
