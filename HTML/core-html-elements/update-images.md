## Quiz

Why is assigning height & width attributes to an image size more useful than setting the image size in CSS?

???

* Page loads with assigned space for images preventing layout shifts. 
* Using HTML height & width attributes is never better than CSS.
* When image size needs to override the CSS size setting.
* When the height and width is differen than the default image size.

If a image does not have an assigned height and width using HTML or CSS, how will the image display within a web page?

???

* At its original image size.
* Will resize filling the container it is within. 
* Will resize by default to 100px wide.
* It will only resize if the image is larger than the viewing area.
