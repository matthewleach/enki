Leading is the vertical space between lines of text, from the baseline (the bottom of such letters like 'a') to the top of the letters below. Descenders, from letters such as 'j' and 'g', fall under the baseline and within the leading. 

Leading is pronounced as *ledding* and earned its name from the actual bars of lead that where used to separate lines of text in the printing press. 

Traditionally for readability, leading should be 20% greater than the font size.  Although, based on the typeface and purpose, this can be adjusted accordingly. 

Leading in CSS is written as:

```
p {
  line-height: 120%;
}
```
